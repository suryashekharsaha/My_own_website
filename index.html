    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> Hi! I am Surya Shekhar Saha. And I am the creater and designer of this page. I read in class VII, of DPS Durgapur. I live in West Bengal, In India. I am of 11 years. I love to play badminton. I also love to play Ludo, Chess and Carrom. My hobbie is to code. I also love reading books, especially of Harry Potter. I will link a detailed webpage of the book so that you may know what "Harry Potter" is. I am also fond of travelling, specially through flights. I have travelled through flights a lot of times, long connection, and short travelling as well. The recent was the trip to Shimla-Manali just like a few weeks ago. 
            My aim in life is to become is to become a scientist and if possible, a coder as well. 
            I want to expand my knowledge of coding to be able to solve our daily issues through coding. So, I am learning coding at Whitehat Jr. Through this knowledge, I am making this web page (which I hope will be good...).

    <h1>My favorite book</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> Well, I have not read so much of books but, I have read some. And my favourite one of all time is Harry Potter. Once, I bought a book of Robinson Crosoe. It was indeed a very big mistake as I didn't understand any word of that book. Such a big mistake! Nevermind, I have kept it safe and secure.Well, moving on to Harry Potter,the author of the book is J.K. Rowling, who has, in fact become a billionare by selling books. It suggests the kind of story she has written and how demanding, I mean, How good the  story is.  So many people have bought the book. I, at first thought that Harry Potter is a book for only good readers, but when I saw the movie, It grew my interest and I started to read the books. Refresing, and an enjoyable book. And the theme music is fantastic! It gave me the nostalgia of Harry Potter in his first year. Though, for me, I feel the first year has left a mark in my heart.
        So good... I can't forget. I suggest you to read the same book. Other than Harry Potter, I also like Gerenimo Stilton and Enid blyton Series. What I feel VERY good about the Enid Blyton series is that the chapters can be read in a short span of time since every chapter has almost 4 pages, which can be read in less that 2 minutes. So, I can read it, like whenever there is a small span of time to start something.</p>

    <h1> My Hobbies</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> Coding includes most of my hobbies. Others are, but I am not very interested in it. Coding is my favourite since, I like tecnology. I want to know how all these are made. And I think most of this comes from science and coding. You know, When we feel hot, we use A/C. Do we have to reach the 11th floor? No issues. Use the lift, instead of stairs. Bored of playing 2D games? Play them in VR sets! There are solutions, but not for all. Why not for all? That what I want to figure out. How can I make my life with no issues? Well, other than that of coding, I like to read books. Just as I said I want to be a scientist and a coder, I have to gain knowledge. And the knowledge comes from books. So, they are my friends.</p>

    <h1>My favourite sport</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Though I am not so good in sports, I have, a sport which is my favourite. I like to play badminton. If you don't know what's badminton, check out the links down below. Yes... So, I like to play badminton for a simple reason-I am good at it. You CAN say it's my favourite sport. But still I won't consider it to be my VERY favorite sport, since I am not so well-connected to sports... But if you ask my favourite sport, I would say it is Badminton, of course, in all my sports I have played, I think it's my favourite. Nothing more to share...So that's all.</p>
